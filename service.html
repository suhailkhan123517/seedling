                The Directors of the company must have a digital signature
                certificate to file the company formation. As the process is
                completely online, so all the forms are required to have a
                signature.
              </p>

                A DSC certificate is compulsory for all subscribers and has it
                in the Memorandum of Association (MoA) and Articles of

                recognised, and the cost depends on the certifying authority.

              </h2>
              <p class="desc mb-4">
                The DIN number must be obtained by the person who wants to be a
                Director of a company. One DIN is enough to become a director.
                To obtain the number, fill the SPICe+ Form with details such as
                the name of the proposed director, PAN card, Aadhar card, and
                address proof. A maximum of three directors can apply for DIN
                but if the applicant wants to incorporate more than three
                directors. Here first the company should be incorporated with
                three directors and then appoint a new director after
                incorporation.

              <p class="desc">
                Reserve the name through the SPICe+ form, in this two proposed
                names can be reserved and one re-submission can be done while
                reserving Unique Names of the Companies.
              </p>
              <p class="desc">
                In case the name gets rejected due to any similarity or other
                reason, the applicant has to refile another SPICe+ form with the
                prescribed fees. Once the name gets approved, it will be
                reserved for 20 days. During this time the company must proceed
                with the incorporation process by submitting Part B of the
                SPICe+ form.
              </p>
              <p class="desc">
                Another option for name approval is by filing Part-A and Part-B
                of the SPICe+ Form together: The company can file the name along
                with the application for incorporation. Part B of the SPICe+
                enables applying for incorporation.
              </p>
              <p class="desc">
                In case of rejection of the application due to non-approval of
                the name, the applicant will get a chance to refill the same
                SPICe+ form without any further charges. This means you get two
                chances to change the name without paying an extra charge of Rs.
                1000/- both times.
              </p>
              <p class="desc mb-4">
                After getting the second chance, even if the name gets rejected,
                then the applicant has to file the SPICe+ form from scratch. So,
                this option is cheaper as compared to the first one. The whole
                process of name approval and incorporation takes 2-3 days.

              <p class="desc mb-4">
                First, the MoA and AoA are required to be filed physically. But

                form with SPICe+ (INC-32). Both documents must be digitally

              <p class="desc">
                With the help of the SPICe+ form, PAN and TAN can be applied.
                The system will automatically generate the form after the
                submission of the SPICe+ form. An email containing the
                certificate of incorporation, PAN and TAN will be sent to the
                applicant. The PAN card will be issued by the Income Tax
                Department.

                If all the details filled in the form are correct, the MCA will

                A company can incorporate in India with a minimum amount of
                capital, and there is no need for shareholders to have a fixed
                amount of capital. So, while setting up the capital structure
                the following points should be considered:
              </p>

              <p class="desc">
                Face Value of Share: The face value of a share is typically the
                price per share at which the company is incorporated. The face
                value of shares can be Rs. 1 or Rs. 10 or Rs. 100 or Rs. 1000 or
                Rs. 10,000.
              </p>

                Authorized Capital: The total amount of stock that a company can
                issue to its shareholders. All companies are typically formed
                with an authorized capital of Rs. 1 lakh or Rs. 10 lakhs. If a
                larger authorized capital is required, the company must pay
                additional fees to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. A
                company's authorized capital can be increased at any time after
                incorporation.
              </p>

              <p class="desc mb-4">
                Paid-up Capital: A company's paid-up capital is the number of
                shares issued to shareholders in exchange for money paid or
                deposited to the company. A company's paid-up capital cannot be
                greater than its authorized share capital.

                incorporation process. The KYC process should be complete. This
                verification ensures that their phone number and email address
                on record with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs are up to
                date-and accurate.

                between January and March it has the option to include its MCA

                      These classes control the overall appearance, as well as
